Work flow for Game of life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead


// need to create an array of arrays using a function to represent the cells

//Iterate through all cells[rows][cols]

//use the math.random method to randomly fill squares with 1 or 0

//1 representing the live cells and 0 representing dead cells

//after a life a group of cells dies and the next life starts, i want it to use the last life as a reference to create the cells in the new life

//create rules for the cells along the edges

//create the rules *Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead

Work Flow for my bot[bumblebee]


I want to create a request to motivational quotes so my bot has an async action where every 24 hours it sends one in my bots chat

https://zenquotes.io/
https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable


Version 1

Input /quote 

Bot receives the command + extra data~happy or motivation 

Communicate with api

Api responds

Send it back to the user

They get a quote based off the word
